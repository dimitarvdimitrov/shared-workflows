# Go Flaky Tests

A GitHub Action that detects and analyzes flaky Go tests by fetching logs from Loki.

## Features

- **Loki Integration**: Fetches test failure logs from Loki using LogQL queries
- **Flaky Test Detection**: Identifies tests that fail inconsistently across different branches

## Usage

```yaml
name: Go Flaky Tests
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 9 * * 1" # Run every Monday at 9 AM
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  analyze-failures:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Go Flaky Tests
        uses: grafana/shared-workflows/actions/go-flaky-tests@main
        with:
          loki-url: ${{ secrets.LOKI_URL }}
          loki-username: ${{ secrets.LOKI_USERNAME }}
          loki-password: ${{ secrets.LOKI_PASSWORD }}
          repository: ${{ github.repository }}
          time-range: "7d"
          top-k: "5"
```

## Inputs

| `loki-password` | Password for Loki authentication. If using Grafana Cloud, then the access policy for this token needs the `logs:read` scope. | ❌       | -       |
| `repository`    | Repository name in 'owner/repo' format                                                                                       | ✅       | -       |
| `time-range`    | Time range for the query (e.g., '1h', '24h', '7d')                                                                           | ❌       | `1h`    |
| `top-k`         | Include only the top K flaky tests by distinct branches count                                                                | ❌       | `3`     |

## Outputs

| Output             | Description                                     |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `test-count`       | Number of flaky tests found                     |
| `analysis-summary` | Summary of the analysis results                 |
| `report-path`      | Path to the generated analysis report JSON file |

## How It Works

1. **Fetch Logs**: Queries Loki for test failure logs within the specified time range
2. **Parse Failures**: Extracts test names, branches, and workflow URLs from logs
3. **Detect Flaky Tests**: Identifies tests that fail on multiple branches or multiple times on main/master

## Flaky Test Detection Logic

A test is considered "flaky" if:

- It fails on the main or master branch, OR
- It fails on multiple different branches

Tests that only fail on feature branches are not considered flaky, as they likely indicate legitimate test failures for that specific feature.

## Local Development

Run the analysis locally using the provided script:

```bash
# Set required environment variables
export LOKI_URL="your-loki-url"
export REPOSITORY="owner/repo"
export TIME_RANGE="24h"
# Run the analysis
go run ./cmd/go-flaky-tests
```

## Requirements

- Go 1.22 or later
- Access to Loki instance with test failure logs

## Output Format

The action generates a JSON report with the following structure:

```json
{
  "test_count": 2,
  "analysis_summary": "Found 2 flaky tests. Most common tests: TestUserLogin (3 total failures; recently changed by alice), TestPayment (1 total failures; recently changed by bob)",

  "flaky_tests": [
    {

        "main": 2,
        "feature-branch": 1
      },
