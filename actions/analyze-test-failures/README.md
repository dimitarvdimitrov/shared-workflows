# Analyze Test Failures

A GitHub Action that analyzes test failures by fetching logs from Loki, identifying flaky tests, and finding their authors.

## Features

- **Loki Integration**: Fetches test failure logs from Loki using LogQL queries
- **Flaky Test Detection**: Identifies tests that fail inconsistently across different branches
- **Git History Analysis**: Finds test files and extracts recent commit authors

## Usage

```yaml
name: Analyze Test Failures
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 9 * * 1'  # Run every Monday at 9 AM
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  analyze-failures:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Analyze Test Failures
        uses: grafana/shared-workflows/actions/analyze-test-failures@main
        with:
          loki-url: ${{ secrets.LOKI_URL }}
          loki-username: ${{ secrets.LOKI_USERNAME }}
          loki-password: ${{ secrets.LOKI_PASSWORD }}
          repository: ${{ github.repository }}
          time-range: "7d"
          top-k: "5"
```

## Inputs

| Input | Description | Required | Default |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `loki-url` | Loki endpoint URL | ✅ | - |
| `loki-username` | Username for Loki authentication | ❌ | - |
| `loki-password` | Password for Loki authentication | ❌ | - |
| `repository` | Repository name in 'owner/repo' format | ✅ | - |
| `time-range` | Time range for the query (e.g., '1h', '24h', '7d') | ❌ | `1h` |
| `repository-directory` | Relative path to the directory with a git repository | ❌ | `${{ github.workspace }}` |
| `top-k` | Include only the top K flaky tests by distinct branches count | ❌ | `3` |

## Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `test-count` | Number of flaky tests found |
| `analysis-summary` | Summary of the analysis results |
| `report-path` | Path to the generated analysis report JSON file |

## How It Works

1. **Fetch Logs**: Queries Loki for test failure logs within the specified time range
2. **Parse Failures**: Extracts test names, branches, and workflow URLs from logs
3. **Detect Flaky Tests**: Identifies tests that fail on multiple branches or multiple times on main
4. **Find Test Files**: Locates test files in the repository using grep
5. **Extract Authors**: Uses `git log -L` to find recent commits that modified each test
6. **Resolve Usernames**: Looks up GitHub usernames for commit hashes

## Flaky Test Detection Logic

A test is considered "flaky" if:
- It fails on the main branch, OR
- It fails on multiple different branches

Tests that only fail on feature branches are not considered flaky, as they likely indicate legitimate test failures for that specific feature.

## Local Development

Run the analysis locally using the provided script:

```bash
# Set required environment variables
export LOKI_URL="your-loki-url"
export REPOSITORY="owner/repo"
export TIME_RANGE="24h"
export REPOSITORY_DIRECTORY="."

# Run the analysis
./run-local.sh
```

## Requirements

- Go 1.22 or later
- Git repository with test files
- Access to Loki instance with test failure logs

## Output Format

The action generates a JSON report with the following structure:

```json
{
  "test_count": 2,
  "analysis_summary": "Found 2 flaky tests. Most common tests: TestUserLogin (3 total failures; recently changed by alice), TestPayment (1 total failures; recently changed by bob)",

  "flaky_tests": [
    {
      "test_name": "TestUserLogin",

      "total_failures": 3,
      "branch_counts": {
        "main": 2,

      ]
    }
  ]
}
